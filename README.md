# Tenant

> Lease subdomains with ease.

## About

Inspired by [JS.org](http://js.org), Tenant allows you to have your own Github repository where users can request a subdomain linked to a CNAME DNS value. Users request subdomains by opening up a PR in the repo with an edited `domains.json`. The changes are only actually published when you merge the PR.

The only actually required step of this process is the editing of `domains.json`, and updating the version in the main branch.

## Setup

> Prerequisite: A cool domain that is [set up with Cloudflare](https://community.cloudflare.com/t/step-1-adding-your-domain-to-cloudflare/64309)

3. Test it out by creating a PR with an edited `domains.json` value.
